bevore encoder, looking at data
image is B, L, W, H, C
after batching action is  16,64,6


moved to C, W, H
failed in obs_step doing a linear operation , input (16, 9728)  on weight (out features=512, in features=6912)
possibly something to do with actions (which dim is not used? in the codebase)

how we got to 9728 and not 6912?
embed + deter = 9216 + 512

but was extected 
embed + deter = 6400 + 512

the embedding size is calculated incorrectly, its set in the encoder output size after initialization
noted size [64,64] and action num is defined in the config ( and is not taked from the environment)

corrected obs size by resize wrapper, now have disagreement on decoder supervision head for channel axis (need to check MultiDecoder defined and used shapes)

all is fixed, except for the logger, where we need to support saving videos
