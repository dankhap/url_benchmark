1. finished running icm rebuffered pretraining to collect exploration buffers for walker and quadruped
2. done finetuning using these buffers as total warmup buffers for 2*6 tasks
3. compared results with RND finetuning. looks good, still vanilla RND better
4. finished running RND rebuffered pretraining, collected exploration buffers (walker + quadruped)
5. now need to tests all 6 tasks using RND buffers
